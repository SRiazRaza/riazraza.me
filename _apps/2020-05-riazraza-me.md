âœ¨ This is the old version of my personal website, created as a portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a FullStack JAM developer. The site was built using **Gatsby** and **React**, featuring a homepage, about page, contact page, and project portfolio. It provided a smooth user experience, optimized for fast loading with static content. The website also used **GraphQL** for querying data and integrated **React Slider** for dynamic elements.
